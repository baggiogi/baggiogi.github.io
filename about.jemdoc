= About me

~~~
I'm a PostDoc in the [http://www.me.ucr.edu Department of Mechanical Engineering] at [https://www.ucr.edu University of California, Riverside], working in [http://www.dei.unipd.it/~augusto/Welcome.html Fabio Pasqualetti]’s group.

I’ve earned my Ph.D. (/summa cum laude/) in [http://www.dei.unipd.it Information Engineering] at the [http://www.unipd.it University of Padova], under the supervision of [http://www.dei.unipd.it/~augusto/Welcome.html Augusto Ferrante] in February 2018.  During my Ph.D. I spent a visiting period  (October 2015 - June 2016) in the [http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk Control Group] at the [http://www.cam.ac.uk University of Cambridge], under the supervision of [http://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre/ Rodolphe Sepulchre]. Prior to that, I received a M.Sc. in Automation Engineering and a B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering (/summa cum laude/) both from University of Padova.\n


My current research interests are in the areas of Control and Analysis of Dynamical Networks, with a special focus on biological applications. Other interests include problems of Systems Theory, Stochastic Modeling and Estimation, and Quantum Information Theory.

/By the way, I love Cinematography (the masterpieces of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bresson Robert Bresson], in particular) and (pure and applied) Mathematics./
