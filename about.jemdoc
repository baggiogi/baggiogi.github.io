= About me

~~~
I'm a PostDoctoral Scholar in the [http://www.me.ucr.edu Department of Mechanical Engineering] at [https://www.ucr.edu University of California, Riverside], working in [http://www.fabiopas.it Fabio Pasqualetti]’s group.

In February 2018, I’ve earned my Ph.D. (/cum laude/) in the [http://automatica.dei.unipd.it Automatic Control Group] of the [http://www.unipd.it University of Padova], under the supervision of [http://www.dei.unipd.it/~augusto/Welcome.html Augusto Ferrante].  During my Ph.D. I spent a visiting period  (October 2015 - June 2016) in the [http://www-control.eng.cam.ac.uk Control Group] of the [http://www.cam.ac.uk University of Cambridge], under the supervision of [http://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre/ Rodolphe Sepulchre]. Prior to that, I received a M.Sc. in Automation Engineering (/cum laude/) and a B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering (/cum laude/) both from the [http://www.unipd.it University of Padova]. \n

My current research interests lie broadly in the area of Control and Analysis of Dynamical Networks, with a special emphasis on biological applications. Other active interests include topics of Systems and Control Theory, Stochastic Modeling and Estimation, and Quantum Information Theory. \n
