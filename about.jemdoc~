= About me

~~~
I'm a Ph.D. student in Information Engineering at the University of Padova, under the supervision of Prof. Augusto Ferrante. I received my M.Sc. in Automation Engineering and my B.Sc. in Mechatronics Engineering both from University of Padova. My current research interests are focused on the fields of Spectral Factorization and Quantum Information & Control Theory. Here you can find my [MyCV.pdf slides full CV].

By the way, I love Cinematography (the masterpieces of Robert Bresson and Carl Th. Dreyer, in particular) and (pure and applied) Mathematics.
